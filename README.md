**Last Updated:** 2024-09-26, **Last Updated By:** Idil Yaktubay (iyaktubay@iisd-ela.org)

## Background
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help everyone discover IISD-ELA publications, we have compiled an online publications database on Google Sheets and developed a search interface to that database using the open-source Python framework called ```streamlit```. The search interface has been deployed on Streamlit Community Cloud and can be found [here](https://iisd-ela-pubs-search-engine.streamlit.app/). Our long-term goal is to embed the search interface into the IISD-ELA website for all website users to access.
